/// \brief Computes lab frame matrix elements <a b|V|c d> in HO basis of
/// the Coulomb interaction (or another radial potential).
///
/// By default, the interaction matrix is given in COM coordinates,
/// then transformed the lab frame on the fly using the Talmi matrices. This
/// is the fastest option for 2 or 3-body problems.
///
/// The user \em may also precompute lab frame matrix elements. This is especially
/// handy if many-body calculations (as opposed to 2 or 3-body) are performed.
/// Then, precomputeLabFrameMatrix() should be called before use. This
/// is really not useful for 2-body problems, since the number of matrix elements created
/// will be much higher than the resulting Hamiltonian matrix in general! For 3-body problems
/// this is not so \em asymptotically, but in \em practice it is.
///
/// Most likely, an instance of QdotInteraction will be fed to a QdotMatrixElements instance.
/// The latter computes the matrix elements <(a sigma) (b tau) | V | (c sigma') (d tau')>, i.e.,
/// it adds spin degrees of freedom.
///
/// QdotInteraction has an instance of RadialPotential which defines the actual potential.
/// By default, this is a Coulomb potential.
///
/// QdotInteraction also can compute the effective interaction in the lab frame.
///
///
/// Typical use:
/// \code
/// QdotInteraction m;
/// m.setR(5);
/// m.setRadialPotential( u ); // assign a RadialPotential instance, if not Coulomb is wanted.
/// m.buildInteractionBlocks(); // builds Coulomb interaction.
/// if (i_want_to_precompute_in_lab_frame)
///   m.precoputeLabFrameMatrix();
///
/// // Ready to use! Call singleElement(N1,m1,N2,m2,N3,m3,N4,m4) to calculate!
